title: Managing GitHub and Bitbucket accounts on one machine

I have multiple bitbucket accounts and one on github. I started to notice that my commits are not getting registered on github. 

This problem can be solved by assigning user.email and names to each repository. So by default git will use system user name. Each git repository has .git/config file wherein one can specify [user] info.

Appending the following information solved this for me.

vi git_repo/.git/config

[user]
	name = John Doe
	email = johndoe@mail.com
