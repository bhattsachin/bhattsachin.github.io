Why does geometric mean exist? Arithmatic mean shows a central tendecy of a discrete variable and looks like enough of a metric. Why did the world not stop there?

It seems a lot of mathematics was developed around practical usecases(I wish I had thought so when in school). For instance in finance we want to see average percent gain for a given portfolio/company. Say a broker does 40% and 70% gain in first two years but looses all the money in third. Arithmatic mean would still show that brokers mean gain in positive. However a 100% loss would mean, all the money gained over years as lost. So we want to heavily penalize any such cases and invest only where our money keeps floating.  

So the use case would be, we want to measure a central tendency where our return will always be postive. Geometric mean does this beautifully. 

Food for thought: Can there be another expression which can achieve the same result?
