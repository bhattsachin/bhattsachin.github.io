<p style="text-align:justify;">The most common question I encounter is "Wassup?"</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">"kya Chal raha hai". As part of normal civilized world I end up saying "Everything is fine". I sometimes feel this question is very silly.  Although it's conversation starter but I still feel it's useless. Take another case suppose you were out of office for a week. People will repeatedly ask you the same question "Where had you been? What were you upto?". It's good that we have something like Twitter where in I can update &amp; tell my friends what I am upto these days.</p>
<p>But not everyone is on twitter &amp; following me. The real physical world is still different. How do I solve my problem?</p>
<p>Here is a solution. Nowadays T-shirts with digital prints have come. One with minimalistic design is here.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">It displays current time. So if someone continously keeps on pestering you by asking "current time", you can buy this tee &amp; save your energy &amp; enjoy silence. If the technology advances further with more display units connected together &amp; in smaller size to get even small fonts, I can find my solution. Every T-shirt will use Solar energy/body heat/light for display. Also they will have a small wireless/bluetooth interface through which the messages can be updated. Say if there is wifi in the area, it will pick up signal &amp; connect to internet &amp; then update your tweet message onto your tweet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will be able to walk hassle free with no useless questions to answer. This T-shirt has many innovative usages. I feel it will end the digital divide with the reality.</p>
