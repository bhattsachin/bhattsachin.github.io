<p>These days we see lot of image based apps in market. In addition to improving image quality they provide with different filters which increases overall appeal of an image. </p>
<p>I am currently facing a problem where we need to automate this process. We need to find out which filter suits best for an image. This is different than Google Picasa's "I am feeling lucky" feature. In that we try to fit our normal curve for image exposure to get best results. However here it's more of an artistic choice. If we have enough data on images and filters applied to them, we can certainly build a model on top of it.</p>
<p>Can we find a setting which would appeal to most of the users? If we do the more important would be to personalize it. Find a setting which a particular user would love the most.</p>
