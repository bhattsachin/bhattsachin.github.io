<p>Today at 2 PM I found I have accomplished all my goals I had set in the morning. It was an effective day for me with 3 hours to spare. So I am writing this blog sharing an information how you too can achieve it using a todo list.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31" title="todolist" src="/assets/todolist.png" alt="todolist" width="380" height="239" /></p>
<p>1.  Prepare a TO DO list</p>
<p>Every day in the morning set up a task list that you are planning to do.</p>
<p>2.  Do not overload yourself</p>
<p>Do not plan everything on your first day. start with small steps &amp; keep on increasing list of tasks as you feel more efficient</p>
<p>3.  Something unavoidable</p>
<p>At times issues come up which might take extra time. So it is always better to break up big task into small tasks and estimate time.</p>
<p>4.  I didn't plan this</p>
<p>It often happens you get a query to solve which you didn't plan early morning, or your boss presents you new task on priority. No worries just add it as part of your day's task &amp; try finishing that first.</p>
<p>5.  what if you missed something</p>
<p>There is always a new day. Just add tasks you missed yesterday on today's task list &amp; depending on that limit your current days list size</p>
<p>6.  Am I doing it right</p>
<p>Your every action should be towards finishing that task list. Keep on asking yourself regularly "what task am I targeting right now".</p>
<p>7.  Just tick it</p>
<p>Keep on clicking your task list as soon you finish it &amp; keep your eyes fixed on unchecked list.</p>
<p>9.  Give your best</p>
<p>Working on a task doesn’t mean you just finish it for the sake of it. Give the best you can offer but do not over do it.</p>
<p>10.  Feel a sense of accomplishment</p>
<p>At the end of the day say to yourself "I have done a great work today". Give a psychological pat to yourself. This will give you energy to keep going.</p>
<p>These steps will help you save time for yourself everyday which you can utilize for your personal development &amp; hobbies.</p>
