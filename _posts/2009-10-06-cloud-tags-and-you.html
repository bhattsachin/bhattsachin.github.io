<p style="text-align:justify;">Last week I happened to view tag cloud of my favorite web urls. I have been active on delicious for last 2.5 years now. When I looked at the map hence generated, it came as a surprise to me.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34" title="tagCloud" src="/assets/tagcloud.png" alt="tagCloud" width="720" height="561" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This cloud also talks a lot about one's personality &amp; thoughts. One saves bookmarks with a thought that they will be useful in the future. So tag cloud shows how one wants his future to be. I feel it is just a projection of one's mind on a digital format.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Have you seen your tag cloud? Give a try today.</p>
