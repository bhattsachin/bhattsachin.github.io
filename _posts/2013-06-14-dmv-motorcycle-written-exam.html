<p style="text-align:justify;">This week I got my California driving license back in lieu of my old NY license. California laws are more strict and they make you write an exam before issuing you a license. You only need to answer 18 of them with maximum of 3 incorrect answers. There are tons of sample papers available on Internet to prepare for this exam. I also had to appear for another written exam for motorcycle. There are very few resources for practicing for this exam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I found this link with few <a title="motorcycletest" href="http://www.drivingdirectory.com/motorcycletest/index.php" target="_blank">test papers</a>. I did go through all of them and there were many questions from this set. However there were still few questions in the exam which I had no clue about. This exam has 25 questions and you cannot pass if you make more than 4 incorrect entries. I failed in my first attempt and could marginally pass in second. Here are the two exams I took that day (<a title="exam1" href="http://www.bhattsachin.me/resources/dmv/dmv_motorcycle_exam1.pdf" target="_blank">exam1</a>) &amp; (<a href="http://www.bhattsachin.me/resources/dmv/dmv_motorcycle_exam2.pdf" target="_blank">exam2</a>). Hopefully they can help you prepare well for yours.</p>
